Reflection:
Some challenges that we faced during this project is code compatibility as some of our code didn't exactly match or fit in well with one another, needing for us to put some extra time into cleaning up the combined code to work with another. Another challenge was getting the base structure of the code started, because envisioning coding projects when you are alone is slightly easier due to having a certain image or structure of how you want the code to run in your mind, whereas in a group setting multiple ideas clash and the code structure is much more undefined in the beggining. A positive is the reduced work time to make the code due to the portioned sections, aswell as having the ability to allocate tasks to group members that are more capable at doing certain coding tasks than others, allowing us to play to our strengths. We overcame our challenges by reflecting on what each group member was capable of in terms of coding and giving tasks that correspond to that skill level, and by communicating and sharing ideas to be put together during the process. Overall the group views the project as a positive experience in collaboration due to the lower work load and ability to work together to make a more refined product due to peer evaluation, however the project contibuted to some stress due to difficulty of understanding at times and clashing ideas, but those are only small problems compared to the positives gained.
